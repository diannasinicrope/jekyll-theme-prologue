Project 1:
Avocado sales in the U.S.

This project studies the sales trends of avocados in the U.S. from 2015 through 2018. Particular attention was given to the differences in trends of conventional vs. organic avocados. This project was conducted in R and presented in PowerPoint.

Business applications:
Product sourcing analytics for retail
Environmental climate change and how it affects produce sales
Grocery retailers and the demand for organic products

Project 2:
Tree census in NYC

This project analyzes the 2015 tree census in New York City. A group of volunteers and paid workers collected information for every tree on public property in all five boroughs of the city. My analysis studies the types and populations of trees, their locations, and their correlations with socio-economic data in NYC. This project was conducted in R.

Business applications:
Environmental studies and changes to tree populations based on tree data
Socio-economic studies for different area codes in NYC (e.g., does having more money and more trees equal better healthcare?)
Study on invasive species in urban populations

Project 3:
A study of wine reviews from WineEnthusiast

My wine reviews project takes a look at almost 17K reviews posted by consumers from as recently as 2017. This analysis was largely an NLP project, and I used an LDA model from scikit-learn to conduct a preliminary analysis of the different types of wines, in hopes of assigning each wine a category (red, white, or other) based on the text contained in reviews.

Business applications:
Wine importers and sellers could easily learn the lingo of how the public speaks about wines. This would be great for marketing purposes.
Using an LDA model can be applied in a multitude of other industries that rely on unstructured text data. For example, using an LDA model to classify headlines in the news industry could help publishers dig deeper for content audits to see what types of content are the highest (and lowest) performing.

Project 4:
Online retailer data case study

This project starts with a seemingly simple dataset of the number of products, costs, and sales data of products sold by an online retailer from 2009 to 2011. We were able to extract a ton of insightful data out of this dataset, and we conceptualized five key recommendations for this retailer to follow in order to avoid decreasing sales that we had projected. As a group project, this shows my teamwork and leadership skills, as well as the ability to work with someone who comes from a different career background than myself. This project was conducted in Excel and Python, and its results were presented verbally with a PowerPoint presentation as supporting material. 

Business applications:
Identifying the best products for seasonal sales
Customer lifecycle and customer segmentation based on customized KPIs
Optimizing marketing strategies for targeted product sales

Project 5:
How safe is air travel?

This project is one of my favorite storytelling and data visualization projects that I’ve conducted. It studies the incorrect suspicion that commercial air travel is dangerous. It has a light-hearted feel to it and uses easy-to-understand visuals that are easily digestible for anyone in the general public. This project was conducted in Tableau and PowerPoint, with advanced animations in PowerPoint. It also includes a similarly branded infographic, which is a great way to get your information published and available to the public.

Business applications:
Good for companies who need help with translating technical data to non-technical audiences

Project 6:
Studying employee performance in the news industry

This project is from my professional career in the news media industry. It’s a great case study in how to evaluate employee performance based on custom KPIs. It’s also a great way to pinpoint success stories on your team and identify employees that could benefit from further training strategies. This project was performed in Python, using Pandas and the Plotly Express library.

Business applications:
Great way for companies to be able to understand and define their top performers.
Could be easily updated for tracking sales performance with salespeople.

Project 7:
Identifying unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in unstructured text data

This project gives content analysts an effective and decently simple way to extract unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from specific classifications of unstructured text data. 

Business applications:
Quickly pulling bigrams is a way to allow analysts to summarize large amounts of text data, especially when needing to summarize and give proof of concept for text classification projects. 

Project 8:
Podcast development for newsrooms

This project identifies the podcast areas most ripe for development by newsrooms. It contains insights about the current climate of podcasts, benchmarks for the industry, and the research needed to implement revenue strategies based around podcasts produced by newsrooms. 

Business applications:
This study fills a gap that exists in many newsrooms- how to harness the power of content creation and loyal audiences and transfer that power into producing successful podcasts.
