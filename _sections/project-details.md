Project 1:   
How Netflix has drawn Americans away from their stubborn cultural hegemony

This project studies the growth of digital media’s streaming video services. Netflix is analyzed as an industry trailblazer. As the first global content network, the company’s distribution channels are considered as two-way information exchanges that not only spread American culture internationally, but also bring international culture to America. Evidence is presented showing a shift in domestic viewing habits, as well as insightful information about how and why Netflix offers international content to their users.


Project 2:  
Podcasting 101: How newsrooms can break into the world of podcasts  

This project identifies the podcast areas most ripe for development by newsrooms. It contains insights about the current climate of podcasts, benchmarks for the industry, and the research needed to implement revenue strategies based around newsroom podcast production.
Business applications: This study fills a gap that exists in many newsrooms- how to harness the power of content creation and loyal audiences and transfer that power into producing successful podcasts.


Project 3:  
Do Americans really care about organic avocados?  

A study of the sales trends of avocados in the U.S. from 2015 through 2018. Particular attention was given to the differences in trends of conventional vs. organic avocados and how price fluctuations change demand. This project was conducted in R and presented in PowerPoint.
Business applications: Product sourcing analytics for retail environmental climate change and how it affects produce sales, grocery retailers, and the demand for organic products.


Project 4:  
Find the most popular words (and word pairings!) in your text data  

Have you ever wondered what sets your text data apart from other companies? This quick yet surprisingly useful guide provides a solid yet quick foundation in NLP and Stochastic Statistics. This project gives content analysts an effective and decently simple way to extract unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from specific classifications of unstructured text data. Just think, you’ll finally be able to actually use something that you learned about in your high school stat class.
Business applications: Quickly pulling bigrams is a way to allow analysts to summarize large amounts of text data, especially when needing to summarize and give proof of concept for text classification projects


Project 5:  
Tracking Reporter Performance 101: How to use data to help your digital reporters  

A great initial look at what you’re missing by not understanding the depth of data that your newsroom is producing. Good for anyone who’s curious about where to start with information analytics, including media execs, editors, and reporters alike.


Project 6:  
I have an online store- now what? A guide to analyzing online CPG sales  

A surprisingly useful way to segment your customers based on typical KPIs. This project starts with a seemingly simple dataset of the number of products, costs, and sales data of products sold by an online retailer from 2009 to 2011. We were able to extract a ton of insightful data out of this dataset, and we conceptualized five key recommendations for this retailer to follow in order to avoid decreasing sales that we had projected. As a group project, this shows my teamwork and leadership skills, as well as the ability to work with someone who comes from a different career background than myself. This project was conducted in Excel and Python, and its results were presented verbally with a PowerPoint presentation as supporting material.
Business applications: Identifying the best products for seasonal sales Customer lifecycle and customer segmentation based on customized KPIs Optimizing marketing strategies for targeted product sales


Project 7:  
Yes, we know every single tree on public property in NYC. Here's everything you ever wanted to know.  

This project analyzes the 2015 tree census in New York City. A group of volunteers and paid workers collected information for every tree on public property in all five boroughs of the city. My analysis studies the types and populations of trees, their locations, and their correlations with socio-economic data in NYC. This project was conducted in R.
Business applications: Environmental studies and changes to tree populations based on tree data Socio-economic studies for different area codes in NYC (e.g., does having more money and more trees equal better healthcare?) Study on invasive species in urban populations


Project 8:  
A tale of two newspapers  

Taking two of the biggest, most competitive newspapers in the Big Apple, this report considers the history behind their rivalry as well as their fight for digital audience. Various methods of headline text classifications are recommended, as well as real-life use-cases for each machine learning methodology.


Project 9:  
A study of wine reviews from WineEnthusiast  

My wine reviews project takes a look at almost 17K reviews posted by consumers from as recently as 2017. This analysis was largely an NLP project, and I used an LDA model from scikit-learn to conduct a preliminary analysis of the different types of wines, in hopes of assigning each wine a category (red, white, or other) based on the text contained in reviews.
Business applications: Wine importers and sellers could easily learn the lingo of how the public speaks about wines. This would be great for marketing purposes. Using an LDA model can be applied in a multitude of other industries that rely on unstructured text data. For example, using an LDA model to classify headlines in the news industry could help publishers dig deeper for content audits to see what types of content are the highest (and lowest) performing.


Project 10:  
How safe is air travel?  
This project is one of my favorite storytelling and data visualization projects that I’ve conducted. It studies the incorrect suspicion that commercial air travel is dangerous. It has a light-hearted feel to it and uses easy-to-understand visuals that are easily digestible for anyone in the general public. This project was conducted in Tableau and PowerPoint, with advanced animations in PowerPoint. It also includes a similarly branded infographic, which is a great way to get your information published and available to the public.
Business applications: Good for companies who need help with translating technical data for non-technical audiences.
